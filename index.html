                        HTML, CSS, and JS, are some of my favorite projects to get into. 
                        Simply because they give immediate feedback. You're always seeing your project grow, 
                        and that feedback loop is beautiful and addicting.

                    <p>
                        Video game design has long been passion of mine. I've always had a natural ability for games and at some point 
                        I got into making my own games. This started with GameMaker many years ago. I started making my own maps
                        in games such as Starcraft and WC3 and later into full development on Unity. Unity has been my favorite 
                        passtime since the start of Covid. My goal is to build a project and release it on Steam.

                        Lately Python has been another area of interest. With Python I have implemented the A-star algorithm using and
                        created a sudoku solver utilizing backtracking. What interests me about Python is its versatility, and how it's
                        used for AI. AI has always been an interest of mine and I plan on playing around with it soon.

                    From a young age I knew I'd end up with a career involving computers. At the very least I knew I'd be using 
                    computers. At the very least I'd be spending a lot of time with them. I still remember my Comm Tech teacher 
                    introducing programming through Game Maker. We used the drop-n-drag functions to build our first maze game. 
                    I enjoyed it so much that I spent the next 6 months of free time messing around with the built in Game Maker 
                    Language. That's when I decided to go into Software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite my enjoyment of programming, I didn't end up going straight into it. I spent some time pursuing teaching, engineering, 
                    and most recently, getting my pilots licence.
